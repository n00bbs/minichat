# Minichat Planning Documentation

## Scope

The goal of our MiniChat project is to create a streamlined and user-friendly
chat application that facilitates real-time communication through channels and direct messages.
We aim to prioritize a clean and intuitive interface while incorporating essential features like
message editing, deletion, and file uploads.
Our focus is on building a solid foundation for efficient and enjoyable communication.

## Realization

The MiniChat app will be built using a modern tech stack to ensure efficient performance and ease of development.
The frontend will be developed with Nuxt.js, providing a fast, flexible, and SSR-friendly framework.
PrimeVue will be used as the component library, delivering a set of ready-made UI components that will enhance
the user experience by offering an intuitive interface. For authentication Auth0 will be used, allowing for a secure and seamless login process while managing users effectively.
Data storage for users, messages, and channels will be handled with PostgreSQL, while file uploads, such as images
or documents shared within messages, will be handled by MinIO, an object storage solution, providing reliability and
scalability for managing media files. Real-time communication will be achieved through WebSockets or event polling, enabling instant message delivery. These tools will work together to offer an efficient, secure, and responsive platform, fulfilling the projectâ€™s goals
while ensuring scalability for future feature enhancements.

## Resources Required

- Hosted Server:
  A hosted server is necessary to ensure the app is accessible to users at all times.
  Options include cloud hosting providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or Hetzner.

- Auth0 License:
  Auth0 provides a robust authentication and authorization platform,
  simplifying the process of user login and securing access to the app's features.
  An Auth0 license is required to utilize their services.

- Domain:
  A custom domain name enhances the app's professional appearance
  and makes it easier for users to remember and access.

## Target / Actual Analysis

### Target State

There should exist an open source, simple and easy to use chat application,
that supports real-time communication through channels and direct messages.
The application should be accessible to users at all times and provide a clean and intuitive interface.
It should include essential features like message editing, deletion, file uploads and markdown-like message styling.

### Actual State

There are a multitude of chat applications like discord, slack, whatsapp, telegram or Rocket.Chat.
However, most of them are either closed source or are relatively complex to use and setup.
